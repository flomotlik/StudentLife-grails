WebService Interfaces:
This document describes the WebService Interface used in StudentLife. The Mapping Rules together with the according methods will be presented

Mappings:
Always have to provide all ID's for accessing lower items because of AppEngine(e.g. for accessing a university you have to provide id's for country, state and city)
"/app/$controller/$action?/$country?/$state?/$city?/$university?/$course?"
"/"(controller: "application")
