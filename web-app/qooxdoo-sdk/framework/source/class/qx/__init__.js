/** <h3> qooxdoo - a comprehensive and innovative Ajax framework </h3>
 *
 * This is the qooxdoo framework top-level. It is the root of the qooxdoo class
 * hierarchy, and also contains some essential classes.
 *
 * Below you find a list of the contained classes, as well as an overview of all
 * the sub-packages with short descriptions. The classes on this level are
 * usually not something you would want to instantiate directly. Even using them
 * as super-classes is considered advanced usage.  The usual application-level
 * classes are in some of the sub-packages like "qx.ui", while others provide
 * more infrastructure and helper classes. So take your time to look around. The
 * little **+** preceding a name offers more descriptive text when you click on
 * it.
 *
 * All sub-packages are structured in the same way. Use either the hyperlinks in
 * the listing, or the tree navigation structure to navigate to the
 * corresponding packages and their documentation. You can also use the
 * __Search__
 * button to search for class and method names, and the __Legend__ button to find
 * information about the symbols used throughout this reference. The __View__ menu
 * allows you to tailor the amount of information that is displayed with each
 * class, e.g. you can enable display of inherited or protected class members.
